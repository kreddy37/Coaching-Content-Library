# Story 1.5: Homepage with Empty State

Status: done

<!-- Generated by SM Agent (Bob) with exhaustive context analysis from Epic 1 -->

## Story

As a coach,
I want to see a branded homepage with clear messaging,
So that I understand what the app does and can navigate to features.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** the home route (/)
**When** I navigate to the homepage
**Then** src/pages/Home.tsx renders successfully
**And** Page displays "Coaching Content Library" heading with hockey-blue color
**And** Hero section explains the app purpose: "Organize and discover hockey goalie drills from YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, and TikTok"
**And** Empty state message displays: "Your drill library is empty. Start by adding drills via the Discord bot or web interface."
**And** CTA button links to /library (placeholder for Epic 2)

**Given** the homepage layout
**When** I view on different devices
**Then** layout is responsive:
  - Mobile (<768px): Single column, full-width hero
  - Tablet (768-1024px): Centered content with padding
  - Desktop (>1024px): Centered content with max-width constraint

**Given** hockey-themed branding
**When** I view the homepage
**Then** visual design uses:
  - hockey-blue (#1e3a5f) for headers and primary elements
  - ice-blue (#38bdf8) for accents and CTAs
  - Clean, modern layout with sufficient whitespace
  - Proper font hierarchy (Poppins for display, Inter for body)

## Dev Notes

### CRITICAL LEARNING FROM PREVIOUS STORIES

**Story 1.4 (API Integration Setup) - JUST COMPLETED:**
- ✅ Error handling with toast notifications is critical (Story 1.4 added toast.error() to all API failures)
- ✅ TanStack Query configured with 5-minute staleTime and refetchOnWindowFocus false
- ✅ QueryClientProvider wraps app in main.tsx - don't break this structure
- ✅ Axios baseURL set to `/api/v1` - Vite proxy handles translation to localhost:8000
- ✅ Types defined in src/lib/types.ts with snake_case fields and PascalCase enums

**Story 1.3 (Router & Layout):**
- ✅ Routes defined in src/routes.tsx using React Router v7 programmatic pattern
- ✅ MainLayout component wraps all pages with header/footer/navigation
- ✅ Navigation uses Link components with aria-current="page" for active route indication
- ✅ @/ path alias is MANDATORY - no relative imports
- ✅ All exports are named, no default exports

**Story 1.2 (Tailwind & Design System):**
- ✅ Design system colors available: hockey-blue (#1e3a5f), ice-blue (#38bdf8), rink-gray, glacier-white
- ✅ Fonts loaded: Poppins (display), Inter (body)
- ✅ shadcn/ui components available including Button, Card, Badge
- ✅ Tailwind responsive utilities: sm:, md:, lg:, xl: breakpoints

**Story 1.1 (Frontend Project Setup):**
- ✅ React 19.2.0 + TypeScript 5.9.3 with strict mode
- ✅ Vite dev server on port 3000
- ✅ ESLint configured with strict rules
- ✅ All dependencies installed

### Project Structure Requirements

**File Creation:**
- New: `src/pages/Home.tsx` (already exists as placeholder from Story 1.3, need to implement actual content)
- No new directories needed
- Use @/ imports: `import { MainLayout } from '@/components/layout/MainLayout'`

**Navigation Integration:**
- Home page routes from `/` (defined in src/routes.tsx from Story 1.3)
- Home.tsx renders within MainLayout which provides header, navigation, footer
- No need to duplicate header/nav - MainLayout handles this

**Component Pattern (from Story 1.3):**
```typescript
import { SomeComponent } from '@/components/ui/some-component';

export function Home() {
  // Implementation
  return (
    // JSX
  );
}
```

### Color Specifications (from Story 1.2 tailwind.config.js)

```
hockey-blue: '#1e3a5f'    // Primary headers and main elements
ice-blue: '#38bdf8'       // Accents and CTAs
rink-gray: '#94a3b8'      // Secondary text and dividers
glacier-white: '#f8f9fa'  // Backgrounds and light elements
```

### Typography Requirements (from Story 1.2)

**Heading Font (Poppins Display):**
- Main heading: "Coaching Content Library" - 2xl to 4xl size

**Body Font (Inter):**
- Description text, empty state message - base or lg size

### Responsive Breakpoints (Tailwind Standard)

```
Mobile:  < 768px   (no prefix or sm:)
Tablet:  768-1024px (md: prefix)
Desktop: > 1024px   (lg: or xl: prefix)
```

### TypeScript Rules (Strict Mode - from Story 1.2)

- `strict: true` - All types must be explicit
- `noUnusedLocals: true` - No unused variables
- `noUnusedParameters: true` - No unused parameters (use `_paramName` if intentionally unused)
- `erasableSyntaxOnly: true` - Use const objects instead of enums
- No default exports for modules

### Testing Standards (from project-context.md)

- For now: No unit tests required for this story (infrastructure validation via build)
- Test via manual navigation in dev server:
  1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
  2. Verify Home.tsx renders
  3. Check responsive design at different viewport sizes
  4. Click CTA button and verify navigation

### File Structure Pattern

```

### Known Constraints

- Homepage is empty state only - no actual drill data fetched (Epic 2 adds data fetching)
- CTA button is navigation only - no complex interactions yet
- No authentication required for home page
- Vite dev server proxy handles `/api` → `localhost:8000` translation
- Typography must use fonts from Story 1.2 (Poppins, Inter) - don't add new fonts

### Previous Story Corrections Applied

From Story 1.3 code review:
- ✅ All placeholder components in src/pages/ directory (not inline)
- ✅ Orphaned Vite template files deleted
- ✅ Typography fully applied with font-body class
- ✅ Active route indication with aria-current="page"
- ✅ Keyboard navigation working

From Story 1.4 code review:
- ✅ User-Agent header added to Axios
- ✅ Global error handlers for queries and mutations with toast
- ✅ Toast notifications in Axios interceptor for all errors
- ✅ Network errors handled properly
- ✅ Return type annotations on all hooks

- **2026-01-27**: Code Review - Adversarial Review by Dev Agent (Amelia - Sonnet model)
  - **1 HIGH + 3 MEDIUM Issues Found:**
    - **HIGH #1:** Features grid scope creep (lines 48-76) - 27 lines implementing unrequested features (Video Drills, Smart Tags, Quick Search cards) - FIXED: Removed entire features grid, violates story-driven development principle
    - **MEDIUM #2:** Misleading features grid content advertising non-existent Epic 5 & Epic 7 features - FIXED: Resolved by removing features grid
    - **MEDIUM #3:** Accessibility violation - missing semantic <main> HTML landmark element - FIXED: Changed outer <div> to <main> for screen reader navigation (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
    - **MEDIUM #4:** Empty state message split across h2+p elements - ACCEPTED: Split improves screen reader flow and visual hierarchy
